With its robust features and user-friendly design, MediManage ensures efficient and organized clinic operations.

## üìö Features

- Multi-role medical management system with support for patients, doctors, attendants and admins.
- Appointment scheduling and management (create, update, cancel, list).
- Medical records and prescription management with versioned entries.
- Articles, notices and category management for clinic communications.
- Built-in user authentication and role/permission management (Spatie Permission, Fortify).
- Server-side rendering support via Inertia and optional SSR flows.
- Auditing and activity logging for sensitive operations.

## üöÄ Built with

- PHP 8.4+ and Laravel 12
- Inertia.js + React (frontend views)
- TailwindCSS for styling
- SQLite / MySQL (configurable) for database
- Spatie Laravel Permission for roles & permissions
- Barryvdh DOMPDF for PDF generation
- Pest / PHPUnit for tests

## üõ†Ô∏è Project setup

This section explains how to set up the project on a development machine (Windows/XAMPP example). If you're on macOS or Linux, the same steps apply but replace XAMPP with your preferred PHP stack and adapt shell commands accordingly.

Requirements

- PHP 8.4 or later
- Composer
- Node.js (LTS recommended) and npm
- XAMPP (or another local PHP/MySQL stack) for Windows
- Git

Initial setup (Windows + XAMPP + PowerShell)

1. Clone the repository:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Barata-Ribeiro/MediManage.git
cd MediManage
```

2. Install PHP dependencies with Composer:

```powershell
composer install
```

3. Install Node dependencies and build assets:

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

4. Environment file

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update values (DB settings, mailer, app key, etc.). On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

- Generate the application key:

```powershell
php artisan key:generate
```

- If you're using the default sqlite in `.env` (DB_CONNECTION=sqlite), create the database file:

```powershell
New-Item -Path database\database.sqlite -ItemType File -Force
```

5. Database migrations & seeders

```powershell
php artisan migrate --seed
```

6. Start the local server (Laravel development server):

```powershell
composer run dev
#SSR:
composer run dev:ssr
```

Notes about XAMPP

- If you prefer to use Apache from XAMPP, point your virtual host or DocumentRoot to the project `public` folder.
- Ensure the PHP version bundled with XAMPP meets the project's PHP requirement (8.4+). If not, use a more recent PHP installation or update XAMPP.

Common environment variables you should set in `.env`

- APP_URL ‚Äî base URL for the application
- DB_CONNECTION, DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD ‚Äî database connection
- MAIL\_\* ‚Äî mailer settings
- APP_ADMIN_EMAIL, APP_ADMIN_PASSWORD ‚Äî initial administrator credentials used by seeders (check `.env.example`)

Troubleshooting tips

- If you see permission errors writing to `storage` or `bootstrap/cache`, ensure Windows user has write access to those folders.
- If assets don't load, ensure you ran `npm install` and `npm run dev` (or `npm run build` for production) and that `public/build` exists.

## üóÇÔ∏è Folder structure

High-level overview of important folders and files in this repository:

- `app/` ‚Äî Laravel application source (Models, Controllers, Services, Providers, etc.).
- `bootstrap/` ‚Äî Framework bootstrap files and cache.
- `config/` ‚Äî Configuration files for Laravel and packages.
- `database/` ‚Äî Migrations, factories and seeders.
- `public/` ‚Äî Document root; compiled assets and `index.php`.
- `resources/` ‚Äî Frontend assets, views, Inertia React components, styles and JS entry points.
- `routes/` ‚Äî Route definitions split by responsibility (web, api, admin, appointments, etc.).
- `storage/` ‚Äî Logs, compiled Blade views, file uploads and cache.
- `tests/` ‚Äî Pest/PHPUnit tests (Feature & Unit).
- `vendor/` ‚Äî Composer dependencies (do not edit).

Important files

- `.env.example` ‚Äî Example env, copy to `.env` and edit for local environment.
- `artisan` ‚Äî Laravel CLI.
- `composer.json` & `package.json` ‚Äî PHP and Node package manifests.
- `vite.config.ts` ‚Äî Frontend bundler config.

Try it (quick start)

1. Copy `.env` and set DB to sqlite (or configure MySQL). Create sqlite file if needed:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
New-Item -Path database\database.sqlite -ItemType File -Force
php artisan migrate --seed
npm install
npm run dev
php artisan serve
```

2. Open http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser.

## ü™≤ Bugs / ToDo

There are bugs and/or implementations that require some attention.

- Send email to patient with account details.
- Implement permissions field validation.
- Fix UI for link insertion; it should never default to an invalid URL.
- Adjust some form submissions to work with Inertia correctly and update URL parameters accordingly.
- Check for the patient's ID in the sidebar, and allow users to register their patient info conditionally.
- Implement status update functionality for doctors and attendants.
- Implement a better empty state for the medical record.
- Implement a proper regular user dashboard.
- Create about page.
