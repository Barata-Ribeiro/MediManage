                            MediManage is a lightweight, full-stack clinic management product built to help small
                            clinics streamline patient care and administrative workflows. It bundles appointment
                            scheduling, patient records, prescriptions and clinic communications into a single,
                            easy-to-use interface so teams can focus on delivering care instead of wrestling with
                            software.

                        <p>
                            The product is implemented using a modern web stack to ensure fast development and reliable
                            operation: Laravel on the backend, Inertia + React for smooth server-driven UI, and
                            TailwindCSS for rapid styling. It works with SQLite or MySQL and includes tooling for PDF
                            generation and permissions.

                        <p>
                            MediManage was designed with small clinic workflows in mind: quick patient lookups, clear
                            appointment timelines, and a simple interface for medical entries. The product tries to
                            remove friction from daily tasks so staff can spend more time with patients.

                            To try MediManage locally, follow the project README for setup steps — it includes a
                            quick-start that works with XAMPP on Windows and a developer toolchain for building assets
                            and running the app.

                        <h2>A note about this project</h2>
                        <p>
                            While this site reads and behaves like a production product, MediManage is primarily a
                            learning and demonstration project. It was crafted to emulate a polished software product so
                            developers can study a realistic codebase, practice full-stack features, and iterate on
                            real-world concerns like permissions, auditing and server-side rendering.
